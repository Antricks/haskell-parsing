# Haskell-Parsing

## What's this?

These are parsers of different kinds implemented in Haskell working with customly defined combinators.
This whole project is just meant for educational purposes and fun.

It is published under the Unlicense license, which means I really don't care what you'll do with this.

## What is this going to be?

I'm planning on implementing parsers for formats like CSV, JSON, YAML, etc. on the base I'm currently working on.
Again, they will not be intended to be used in production, I do not give any kind of warranty, but you do you.
