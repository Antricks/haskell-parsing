# Haskell-Parsing

## What's this?

These are parsers of different kinds implemented in Haskell working with customly defined combinators.
This project is just meant for educational purposes, but feel free to use my code if you want to.

## What is this going to be?

I'm planning on implementing parsers for formats like CSV, JSON, YAML, etc. on the base I'm currently working on.
Again, they will not be intended to be used in production, but if you want to, feel free.
