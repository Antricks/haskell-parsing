# Haskell-Parsing

## What's this?

These are parsers of different kinds implemented in Haskell working with customly defined combinators.
This whole project is just meant for educational purposes and fun.

It is published under the Unlicense license, which means I really don't care what you'll do with this.

Disclaimer: I have no clue of existing conventions for things like parser combinators etc. so I'm currently making up my own. I might rename my combinators / operators, etc. if I find other versions that would maybe be a bit more logical or already exist with the same functionality in e.g. some other typical libraries. I try to make my combinators make sense if you know basic Haskell though, so they shouldn't be too confusing after reading some of my comments.

## What is this going to be?

I'm planning on implementing parsers for formats like CSV, JSON, YAML, etc. on the base I'm currently working on.
Again, they will not be intended to be used in production, I do not give any kind of warranty, but you do you.
